//MisMatch or Changes In Backend side
1. User Profile picture input as image not as string
2. Backend user database dont have option to add companies as a list but as a string
3. vbc card dont have option to add image
4. vbc card should have option of background colour (random alloted)
5. vbc card can't be search with userId but only with card id and need to clear it as a doubt
